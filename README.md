Nebula X is a modern, user-focused proxy solution designed to enhance browsing privacy and flexibility. It integrates the Ultraviolet Proxy, which allows users to securely route web traffic, ensuring anonymity while browsing. Nebula X features a customizable user interface with a sleek, space-inspired design and tools like a JavaScript Injector and Encoder/Decoder. The platform also includes a Panic Key for quick redirection to a set URL, offering users a discreet escape when needed. The recently added Ultraviolet Proxy integration ensures smooth, secure web browsing, and new tab cloaking options give users full control over tab titles and favicons. Nebula X offers a range of features designed to optimize both security and user experience, making it a powerful tool for anyone who values privacy online.

## ☄️ - Other unbl0ked links / sites.
here at Nebula our main goal is to provide unblocked fun. We understand that our site will have some issues, but there are better sites out there. so we decided instead of trying to hide that we decided to embrace it. this is a list of Working unbl0ked links for games, pr0xies, ai and more. we dont claim any of these sites as ours because they arent. we hope you enjoy these if our service doesnt live up to what it should. thank you for using Nebula! go here for the links --->  https://github.com/Nebula-X-Development/Nebula-X-BETA/blob/main/links%20(not%20Nebula).md
