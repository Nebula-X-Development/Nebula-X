<h2 align="center">Nebula-X BETA</h2>

</p>

  Nebula-X BETA is a glance at what may be to come. The Nebula team is working hard to make one of the cleanest and best looking UIs ever. Currently, we are in a very very BETA phase of the project without having any functionality to the website or a proper host. Please stay tuned and check out what we have so far!

<h2 align="center">Using Nebula-X</h2>

Warning: Nebula-X is currently in its BETA phase and has no real functionality. currently, all you can test and see is the Website design and UI which is all open source. if you would like to check out the website then go to https://preview-nebulax.playcode.io/# or open it locally by using the NEBULA.html file.
The Nebula-X team is woking very hard to design one of the nicest, fastest, and best looking proxies that you will ever see. even though it has not released we would love your feedback on the website design and what you want to see in the future. thankk you all for your support.
